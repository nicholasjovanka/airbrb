Bonus Features:
1. Image Carousel:
In Create Listing and Edit Listing I've made a new requirement where the upload must upload additional images (Other than the thumbnail or youtube video) which I call property Images which will be displayed on a carousel. I believe that this feature is usefull as customer has a higher chance of renting a place if they have more details or more images about the property they are about to rent. Additionaly, this Images can be viewed when a user/visitor visit the listing detail page also in a carousel form
2. Date Logic Validation:
- 2.2.4: Display an Error when the start date in a date range is equal or bigger than the end date. Also checks for collision between date ranges if there is more than 1 date range
- 2.3.2: Display an Error when the Date filter is on and the start date is bigger than the smaller date
- 2.4.2: Display an Error when making a booking if the start date of the booking is bigger than the end date. Also checks if the User selected date range is outside the selected available date range
3. Filter in Manage Bookings (2.5.2) and View Bookings (2.4.1) in : Added a feature that allows a listing owner to filter bookings displayed based on their status, thus allowing owner to easily see booking request that is still pending.
